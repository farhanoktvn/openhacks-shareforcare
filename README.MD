# Share for Care
```
An OpenHack 2020 hackathon project.
```

## Background
A couple weeks ago I read a news on the Internet, a family was found in a barn
in the middle of nowhere starving to their bones. It was stated on the news
that they cannot afford any food since they do not have any money left after being
laid off from work because of COVID-19 restrictions and they got no one to ask for.
This event got me thinking that we have to find a way of sharing that is efficient.

## Intro
Share for Care is a website created for OpenHack hackathon 2020. The vision of
the creator is to make an application that can help people that lack basic
necessities to meet with the people that have and willing to give them, especially
in the current COVID-19 situation. This application will eliminate
'the-man-in-the-middle', making the process faster and more effective.

## Hacking Process
The application is made in the form of a website. The first thing that I did was
to configure the environment and the framework that I am using, which is Django.
After the initialization, I laid out the business logic behind the application
using Django's Model, Template, View. I parallelize my work then also began to work
on the frontend while integrating it with the backend on-the-go. The last thing to
do was to prepare for deployment and push the application to Heroku.

There was only a handful of problem that I encountered, since I made the application
as simple as it can be. Some of the issue were time management and integrating
a new library that I have not tried yet.
